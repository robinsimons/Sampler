Sampler - Toolkit for Simulation Modelling
==========================================

Sampler is Scala library for simulation based modelling and analysis at the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency. This library was designed to 
reduce build time for modelling, allow statistical analyses where classical  approaches struggle due to assumption violation, and perform Approximate
Bayesian Computation (ABC). Core features include:
* Parallel sampling from distributions or models until summary statistic convergence.
* Transformation and summary of empirical distributions.
* Approximation of posterior distributions using Approximate Bayesian Computation.
* Loading WinBUGS coda files and running R scripts on empirical results data for plotting or further analysis.
