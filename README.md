##Sampler - Toolkit for Simulation Modelling

Development is currently in its early stages and exclusively on the 'develop' branch.

Sampler is Scala library for simulation based modelling and analysis.  Core features include:
* Parallel sampling from distributions or models until summary statistic convergence.
* Transformation and summary of empirical distributions.
*Approximation of posterior distributions using Approximate Bayesian Computation.
* Loading WinBUGS coda files and running R scripts on empirical results data for plotting or further analysis.

Sampler is currently in development at the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, with the aim of accelerating the process of building analyses where classical statistical approaches struggle due to assumption violation.
