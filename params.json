Core features include:\r\n* Parallel sampling from distributions or models until summary statistic convergence.\r\n* Transformation and summary of empirical distributions.\r\n* Approximation of posterior distributions using Approximate Bayesian Computation.\r\n* Loading WinBUGS coda files and running R scripts on empirical results data for plotting or further analysis.\r\n\r\nSampler is currently in development at the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, with the aim of reducing build time for analyses where classical statistical approaches struggle due to assumption violation.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n* Optimisation/Experimental design\r\n\t* TODO\r\n* Parameter inference\r\n\t* TODO\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
