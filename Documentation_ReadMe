Issues
======

If ABC generations complete faster than the reporting operations (e.g. running an R script) 
then the entire application may quit before reporting has caught up.

When creating the ScalaDoc with API the index page for the root of the project shows two packages, akka and sampler, where we would prefer it
to lead directly to sampler package

Future Enhancements
===================

Allow ABC tolerance to be configured from config file, e.g. descent rate can be quantile other than 50%

Building documentation
======================

1) Create the documentation on your local machine using either either the doc or unidoc commands in sbt.

	The documentation folder will be created in the target directory; e.g. target/scala-2.10/unidoc/

2) Rename the folder according to the current build e.g. Sampler-0.0.21 and move to the api folder in the gh-pages branch

3) Once pushed, the documentation will be available at tearne.github.io e.g.
	
	tearne.github.io/Sampler/api/Sampler-0.0.21

Troubleshooting
===============

To run the examples within Eclipse the src/main/resources folder needs to be added as a source folder so that config files can be detected

R pre-requisites (for examples)
===============================

install.packages(c("ggplot2", "reshape", "deSolve", "hexbin"), dependencies=T)
